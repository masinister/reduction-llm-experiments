    "$\\implies$: Suppose an assignment $T$ satisfies exactly one literal per clause in $\\phi$. Then, construct an assignment $T'$ for $\\psi$ by assigning all $x_i^{(k)}$'s the same value that $T$ gives to $x_i$. This clearly satisfies exactly one literal in the new clauses, and allows us to treat all $x_i^{(k)}$'s as the same variable $x_i$, recovering the original formula $\\phi$. Hence, $T'$ satisfies exactly one literal per original clause by assumption (because $T$ does).",
    "$\\impliedby$:  Suppose an assignment $T'$ satisfies exactly one literal per clause in $\\psi$. Observe that the new clauses are only satisfied if all $x_i^{(k)}$'s have the same value: $(\\lnot x \\lor y)$ is false if any only if $x$ is true and $y$ is false. In particular, replacing all $x_i^{(k)}$'s by $x_i$ recovers the original formula $\\phi$, and ensures that exactly one literal is satisfied in each of the new clauses. Since $T'$ satisfies exactly one literal per clause in $\\psi$, it does the same for $\\phi$. \\end{proof}"
